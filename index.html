                <p><i>"In science, if you know what you are doing, you should not be doing it.  In engineering, if you do not know what you are doing, you should not be doing it.  Of course, you seldom, if ever, see either pure state."</i></p>
                <div class="quoteCitation">&mdash;Richard Hamming, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000P2XFPA">The Art of Doing Science and Engineering</a></div>

                <p>How can we design systems when we don't know what we're doing?</p>

                <p>The most exciting engineering challenges lie on the <b>boundary of theory and the unknown</b>.  Not so unknown that they're hopeless, but not enough theory to predict the results of our decisions.  Systems at this boundary often rely on <i>emergent behavior</i> &mdash; high-level effects that arise indirectly from low-level interactions.</p>

                <p>When designing at this boundary, the challenge lies not in constructing the system, but in understanding it.   In the absence of theory, we must develop an <i>intuition</i> to guide our decisions.  The design process is thus one of exploration and discovery.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="columnRight" style="width:401px;">

                <p>How do we explore?  If you move to a new city, you might learn the territory by walking around.  Or you might peruse a map.  But far more effective than either is <i>both together</i> &mdash; a street-level experience with higher-level guidance.</p>

                <p>Likewise, the most powerful way to gain insight into a system is by <i>moving between levels of abstraction</i>.  Many designers do this instinctively.  But it's easy to get stuck on the ground, experiencing concrete systems with no higher-level view.  It's also easy to get stuck in the clouds, working entirely with abstract equations or aggregate statistics.</p>

                <p>This interactive essay presents the <b>ladder of abstraction</b>, a technique for thinking <i>explicitly</i> about these levels, so a designer can move among them consciously and confidently.</p>

                <p>I believe that an essential skill of the modern system designer will be using the <i>interactive medium</i> to move fluidly around the ladder of abstraction.</p>

                    <p>We'll start with an in-depth example &mdash; an event-based classroom game called <b>the salmon game</b>. The game is played as follows:</p>
                    <p>2,600 salmon eggs go from their mothers egg-pouch all the way to adult hood. Their journey consists of 13 different events, <strong>detailed to the right</strong>, where at each event, some number of potential offspring are lost.</p>
                    <p>Students keep track of the 2,600 eggs using beans. A 1lb. bag of pinto beans contains approximately 1300 beans. Two pounds = 2600 beans, the approximate average number of eggs laid by 1 female coho.</p>
                    <p>100 beans have a mass of approxmiately 34 grams. When removing beans that are not in groups of 100, have students remove the nearest 100 based on mass, and then count out the beans needed to reach the total.</p>

                    <p> A single female coho salmon lays <span data-var="eggLaying" class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-min="2500" data-max="3000" data-step="1" data-format="%.0f eggs"></span> near the headwaters of the river.
                        <b>Place your fish in the egg/alevin section. </b>
                    </p>

                    <p>Some of the eggs are not successfully ferilized by male coho salmon, so <span data-var="fertilization" class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-min="600" data-max="1000" data-step="1" data-format="%.0f eggs"></span> are lost.
                        Some fertilized eggs become diseased with a fungus and <span data-var="fungusKillsEggs" class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-min="100" data-max="300" data-step="1" data-format="%.0f eggs"></span> are lost.
                        Some fertilized eggs are eaten by birds, so <span data-var="birdsEatEggs" class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-min="100" data-max="300" data-step="1" data-format="%.0f eggs"></span> are lost.
                        A heavy rainstorm hits the watershed. Some eggs are washed downstream and others are covered in tick mud and suffocate. <span data-var="rainAndMud" class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-min="350" data-max="450" data-step="1" data-format="%.0f eggs"></span> are lost.
                        Approximately 40 days have passed since th eggs were fertalized. Small fish called alevin start to emerge as the eggs hatch. They have small yolk sacs attached to their bodies. They will feed off the yolk sacs for several weeks. Alevin stay very close to the bottom of the stream or under the gravel. <b><span data-var="alevin" data-format="%.0f eggs"></span> survived</b> to alevin stage.
                    </p>

                    <p> Not all eggs hatch successfully. Some never emerge and other have mutations, like deformed fins. <span data-var="eggHatching" class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-min="250" data-max="350" data-step="1" data-format="%.0f alevin"></span> are lost.
                        Herons, ducks and kingfishers find alevin at the bottom of the stream and eat <span data-var="eggHatching" class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-min="250" data-max="350" data-step="1" data-format="%.0f alevin"></span>.
                        Six months have passed since the eggs were first laid. The alevin have absorbed all of the yolk sac and are now called fry. <b><span data-var="fry" data-format="%.0f alevin"></span> survived</b> to fry stage.
                        <b>Move your fish to the fry section.</b>
                    </p>

                    <p> Fry swim faster without their yolk sacs, and they move away from the bottom of the stream and out to the edges. gerons, frogs and other fish eat <span data-var="heronsFrogsAndOtherFish" class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-min="180" data-max="200" data-step="1" data-format="%.0f fry"></span>.
                        It is now the middle of the summer, and water temperatures are increasing as the stream level drops. <span data-var="summerWaterLevelDrop" class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-min="160" data-max="180" data-step="1" data-format="%.0f fry"></span> are cought in shallow pools and do not survive the higher temperatures.
                        The surviving fry grow quickly and are now a few inches long. They move downstream and take on a shiny, silver color. As they feed on insects, they reach 6 inches in length. They are now called smolts. <b><span data-var="smolts" data-format="%.0f fry"></span> survived</b> to smolt stage.
                        <b>Move your fish to the smolt section.</b>
                    </p>

                    <p> The smolts are now ready to migrate out to the sea. They have spent 1 full year in the river as freshwater fish. They begin by moving down the estuary to the river.
                        <b>Move your fish to the estuary section.</b>
                    </p>

                    <p> <span data-var="fishKillerWhalesSeaLionsBirds" class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-min="20" data-max="30" data-step="1" data-format="%.0f smolts"></span> are eaten by other fish, killer whales, sea lions and birds.
                        <b><span data-var="adults" data-format="%.0f smolts"></span> survived </b> to the adult stage.
                        Smolts move to the open ocean and grow to adult size. They join schools of coho from other rivers. They spend 1 to 3 years feeding in the ocean and grow to about 2 feet long and about 35 pounds.
                        <b>Move your fish to the ocean section</b>
                    </p>

                    <p> A salmon fishing boat hooks several fish from a school of coho in the ocean. <span data-var="salmonFishingBoat" class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-min="1" data-max="3" data-step="1" data-format="%.0f those adult coho"></span> were from the spawn of your mother coho.
                        A pod of killer whales attacks the school of coho, <span data-var="killerWhale" class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-min="1" data-max="3" data-step="1" data-format="%.0f those adult coho"></span> were from the spawn of your mother coho.
                        In general, 0 to 10 eggs from one pair of coho salmon will survive to become spawning adults.
                        After 2 years in the ocean, the remaining fish return to their native stream, and head back to their spawning grounds to lay their eggs. All coho salmon die after they spawn.
                        The cycle begins again with a new batch of eggs.

                <p>Our first model answers the question:</p>

                <p><b>"How many viable offspring are generated by one mature spawning adult, given these data supported assumptions about survival rates"</b></p>

                <p>In so far as we trust our reasoning, our data and our assumptions, the answer to this question is: "not very many!" The majority of eggs a mother coho lays never make it to adulthood. Based on our data, and our first model, only 2 in 2,600 eggs from this mother coho grow into adults that return to spawn.</p>

                <p>Now that we have a clear and detailed foundation model about the number of surviving eggs, we can start exploring new questions.</p>

                <p>If 2 out of 2,600 eggs survive, how will the coho population grow or decline?</p>

                <p>If we build a dam that makes it more difficult for coho to reach the spawning ground, or for new developing coho to reach the sea, will less than 2 out of 2,600 eggs survive to spawn again? If less than 2 out of 2,600 eggs return to spawn, will our coho population grow or decline over multiple generations?</p>

                <p>The model below feeds the surviving coho from our first model back in as spawning adults. Each spawning adult lays 2,600 eggs, and then the cycle begins again. What do you notice?</p>
