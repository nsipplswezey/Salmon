                <p>The world is complicated. How do we explore it? How do we use what we know to make decisions about what to do next? </p>

                <p>We model the world. And most times, we model it without even thinking about it. We model intuitively and reflexively.</p>

                <p>As we proceed through life, we collect a lot of data. And we have to organize it somehow. So we build mental models that try to organize the information we've collected. We often test those models against data, and we reevaluate our models based on what we observe.</p>

                <p>How did you know what time you had to leave the house to get to work this morning? Over your life time, you've collected a lot of data about being on time. You've likely built a pretty good model, and at some level maybe it includes how many miles you have to travel, how many minutes it takes to travel that distance, how much more time it takes if you hit traffic, and what consequences exist for being late. You've organized all that data into a model that helps you understand a complex real world system just enough to answer a question or make a decision.</p>

                <p>"When should I leave home?"</p>

                <p>Most complex systems rely on <i>emergent behavior</i> &mdash; high-level effects that arise indirectly from low-level interactions. Think about how traffic emerges from the interactions of <i>everyone</i> doing their best to answer the question "when should I leave home?"</p>

                <p>Travel is a complex system for which we have a huge amount of experiential data. What about systems that are unfamiliar to us, systems where we don't have much experience or data? How do we explore those complex systems?</p>

                <p>When exploring emergent systems the challenge lies in navigating a path towards progressively understanding more about it without getting lost. As we explore and discover we develop an <i>intuition</i> to guide our understanding.</p>

                <p>Our intuition is typically built around creating new models of the system we're exploring. Modeling is thus a process of exploration and discovery.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="columnRight" style="width:401px;">

                <p>How do we explore?  If you move to a new city, you might learn the territory by walking around.  Or you might peruse a map.  But far more effective than either is <i>both together</i> &mdash; a street-level experience with higher-level guidance.</p>

                <p>Likewise, the most powerful way to gain insight into a system is by <i>moving between levels of abstraction</i>.  In real life, we do this instinctively. We know when we're late to school. We can stop and think about how many times we've been late this week. We try to find a patterns in what seems to be making us late. Or patterns in how to avoid the consequences of being late. We often do this implicity. And sometimes we get stuck. It's easy to get stuck on the ground, experiencing concrete day-to-day events with no higher-level view. "Ugh. I'm late again! I'm late every day!"  It's also easy to get stuck in the clouds, working entirely with abstract ideas, and lose track of the ground level details. "I'm late, but in the larger scheme of things, maybe I'm right on time."</p>

                <p>When we're working on problems further away from our direct every-day experience, we need to make our exploration explicit.</p>

                <p>This interactive essay implements two techniques for making our modeling and our thinking more explicit. </p>

                <p>The first is called the <b>ladder of abstraction</b>, and specifically, it's a technique for thinking <i>explicitly</i> about these levels, so a thinker can move among abstractions consciously and confidently.</p>

                <p>The second is called <b>iterative modeling</b>, and specifically, it's a technique for thinking <i>explicitly</i> about using past experience to build new models to explore new questions, so a thinker can move among many different related models consciously and confidently.</p>

                <p>I share the belief that an essential skill of the modern citizen will be using the <i>interactive medium</i> to move fluidly around the ladder of abstraction, and thoughtfully between models, so that they can more rapidly build a deeper and more thoughtful understanding of complex systems.</p>

                    <p><strong>Take a look at the narrative below</strong>. Any numbers you change by clicking and dragging left or right will update the whole progression of the coho life cycle. Read the story –don't skim– it's not long, it goes fast, and it's supported by data. Play with the numbers and see what intuition you generate. This story outlines the foundation modeling excercise for the class.</p>

                    <i>
                        <p> "In mid-November, a single female coho salmon lays <span data-var="eggLaying" class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-min="2500" data-max="2700" data-step="1" data-format="%.0f eggs"></span> near the headwaters of a short California coastal stream, and then she dies. With any luck, some of these eggs will become members of the next generation of coho salmon that will return to this stream to lay eggs of their own.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <b>Place your <span data-var="eggLaying" data-format="%.0f eggs"></span> at the head waters, in the egg section. </b>
                        </p>

                        <p>It turns out that about <span data-var="fertilization" class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-min="700" data-max="900" data-step="1" data-format="%.0f of these eggs"></span> are never fertalized by male coho.
                            Then <span data-var="fungusKillsEggs" class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-min="100" data-max="300" data-step="1" data-format="%.0f fertilized eggs"></span> become diseased with a common stream fungus.
                            If that weren't enough, birds eat <span data-var="birdsEatEggs" class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-min="100" data-max="300" data-step="1" data-format="%.0f fertilized eggs"></span>.
                            Then a heavy winter rainstorm hits the watershed, causing flooding and muddy stream conditions that wash <span data-var="rainAndMud" class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-min="350" data-max="450" data-step="1" data-format="%.0f eggs"></span> downstream where they're covered in tick mud, and they never have a chance to hatch.
                        </p>

                        <p>Approximately 40 days after the eggs were fertalized, they begin to hatch. From the eggs emerge small fish called <i>alevin</i>. They have small yolk sacs attached to their bodies, which they'll feed on for several weeks. Alevin stay very close to the bottom of the stream or under the gravel. <b>From the inital <span data-var="eggLaying" data-format="%.0f eggs"></span> only <span data-var="alevin" data-format="%.0f eggs"></span> survived to alevin stage</b>.
                        </p>

                        <p> Not all alevin emerge successfully and <span data-var="eggHatching" class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-min="250" data-max="350" data-step="1" data-format="%.0f alevin"></span> have deformed fins or other mutations that prevent them from surviving.
                            Herons, ducks and kingfishers find alevin at the bottom of the stream and eat <span data-var="birdsEatAlevin" class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-min="250" data-max="350" data-step="1" data-format="%.0f alevin"></span>.
                        </p>

                        <p>Six months have passed since the eggs were first laid. The alevin have absorbed all of the yolk sac and are now called fry. <b>From the surving <span data-var="alevin" data-format="%.0f alevin"></span> only <span data-var="fry" data-format="%.0f alevin"></span> survived to fry stage.</b>

                        <p> Fry swim faster without their yolk sacs, and they move away from the bottom of the stream and out to the edges of the stream, where herons, frogs and other fish eat <span data-var="heronsFrogsAndOtherFish" class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-min="180" data-max="200" data-step="1" data-format="%.0f fry"></span>.
                            It is now the middle of the summer.

                        <p> It's been a little less than a year since the surviving alevin became fry. The surviving fry are now a few inches long. They move downstream and take on a shiny, silver color. As they feed on insects, they reach 6 inches in length. They are now called smolts. The smolts are the first life stage that leaves freshwater and migrates out to the sea. They continue moving down the the river to the estuary. <b>From the surviving <span data-var="fry" data-format="%.0f fry"></span> only <span data-var="smolts" data-format="%.0f fry"></span> survived to smolt stage.</b>

                        <p>Smolts move to the open ocean and grow to adult size. They join schools of coho from other rivers. They spend 1 to 3 years feeding in the ocean and grow to about 2 feet long and about 35 pounds.

                        <p> A salmon fishing boat hooks several fish from a school of coho in the ocean.

                        <p>

                    <p>The narrative above is a perfect starting place. Underneath that narrative is a model, where we start with a certain number of eggs, and then lose them as events in the spawning life cycle occur. This is called an event-based model. And now that you've gone through the model in text and interactive numbers, it's time for students to go through the model in an event-driven classroom game called <b>the salmon game</b>.</p>

                    <p>The game covers the journey of 2,600 salmon eggs as they leave their mothers pouch, and try to become an adult salmon that eventually returns to lay eggs of their own. The journey of the eggs consists of 17 different events, traversing 4 different life stages, and 6 different habitats.</p>
                    <p>At each event, either some number of potential offspring are lost, or the surving offspring move into a new habitat, a new life stage, or both.</p>
                    <p>We'll keep track of these 2,600 eggs and the events and life stages through which they progress using the numbers and events described <strong>to the right</strong>. </p>
                    <p>Students will keep track of the 2,600 eggs using beans, and you'll guide them through the events. A 1lb. bag of pinto beans contains approximately 1300 beans. Two pounds = 2600 beans, the approximate average number of eggs laid by 1 female coho.</p>
                    <p>100 beans have a mass of approxmiately 34 grams. When removing beans that are not in groups of 100, have students remove the nearest 100 based on mass, and then count out the beans needed to reach the total.</p>

                <p>The game detailed above is actually a model of coho salmon spawning, supported by empirical data. It's a specific type of model called an <b>event based model</b> where time doesn't progress in days or months, but instead time progresses in a series of events.</p>

                <p>In the game, this series of events becomes natural to think about, because the events in the game are concrete, descriptive and fit a narrative. This is a great place to start modeling, because it builds a natural comfort and intuition with the system.</p>

                <p>We're going to rely on that foundation to begin modeling more abstractly. We do this for two reasons. The first is that if we want to continue to explore the reproductive strategies of the coho salmon, and we limit ourselves to counting beans every time, we won't have enough time to explore very much. </p>

                <p>The second reason for progressively building abstraction into this concrete model is that abstraction is powerful. If we can thoughtfully abstract across complexity, we can make complexity easier to manage, and refocus our thinking on new questions and new problems. </p>

                <p>Computational modeling allows us to organize and think more abstractly, so that we can empower ourselves to explore complex systems more deeply and thoughtfully, and use the data that we generate to support hypothesis and explanations and to create more robust arguments based on data.</p>

                <p><b>"How many viable offspring are generated by one mature spawning adult, given these data supported assumptions about survival rates"</b></p>

                <p>In so far as we trust our reasoning, our data and our assumptions, the answer to this question is: "not very many!" The majority of eggs a mother coho lays never make it to adulthood. Based on our data, and our first model, only 3 in 2,600 eggs from this mother coho grow into adults that return to spawn.</p>

                <p>Now that we have a clear and detailed foundation model about the number of surviving eggs, we can start exploring new questions.</p>

                <p>If 2 out of 2,600 eggs survive, how will the coho population grow or decline?</p>

                <p>If we build a dam that makes it more difficult for coho to reach the spawning ground, or for new developing coho to reach the sea, will less than 2 out of 2,600 eggs survive to spawn again? If less than 2 out of 2,600 eggs return to spawn, will our coho population grow or decline over multiple generations?</p>

                <p>The model below feeds the surviving coho from our first model back in as spawning adults. Each spawning adult lays 2,600 eggs, and then the cycle begins again.</p>

                <p><i>"In science, if you know what you are doing, you should not be doing it.  In engineering, if you do not know what you are doing, you should not be doing it.  Of course, you seldom, if ever, see either pure state."</i></p>
                <div class="quoteCitation">&mdash;Richard Hamming, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000P2XFPA">The Art of Doing Science and Engineering</a></div>

                <p>How can we design systems when we don't know what we're doing?</p>

                <p>The most exciting engineering challenges lie on the <b>boundary of theory and the unknown</b>.  Not so unknown that they're hopeless, but not enough theory to predict the results of our decisions.  Systems at this boundary often rely on <i>emergent behavior</i> &mdash; high-level effects that arise indirectly from low-level interactions.</p>

                <p>When designing at this boundary, the challenge lies not in constructing the system, but in understanding it.   In the absence of theory, we must develop an <i>intuition</i> to guide our decisions.  The design process is thus one of exploration and discovery.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="columnRight" style="width:401px;">

                <p>How do we explore?  If you move to a new city, you might learn the territory by walking around.  Or you might peruse a map.  But far more effective than either is <i>both together</i> &mdash; a street-level experience with higher-level guidance.</p>

                <p>Likewise, the most powerful way to gain insight into a system is by <i>moving between levels of abstraction</i>.  Many designers do this instinctively.  But it's easy to get stuck on the ground, experiencing concrete systems with no higher-level view.  It's also easy to get stuck in the clouds, working entirely with abstract equations or aggregate statistics.</p>

                <p>This interactive essay presents the <b>ladder of abstraction</b>, a technique for thinking <i>explicitly</i> about these levels, so a designer can move among them consciously and confidently.</p>

                <p>I believe that an essential skill of the modern system designer will be using the <i>interactive medium</i> to move fluidly around the ladder of abstraction.</p>
