                <p>The salmon model creates an engagement activity followed by explanation and exploration activities in the 5E pedagogical model.  These lessons complement investigations in the NGSS performance expectations for ecosystems, human impacts and evolution.  The primary focus of the unit is on the probability of sustaining populations through successful reproduction.  The unit also provides connections to several of the science practices:  engaging argument from evidence, constructing explanations, using mathematics and computational thinking, and analyzing and interpreting data.</p>

This story outlines the foundation modeling excercise for the class.</p>

                        <i>
                            <p> "In mid-November, a single female coho salmon lays <span data-var="eggLaying" class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-min="2600" data-max="2601" data-step="1" data-format="%.0f eggs"></span> near the headwaters of a short California coastal stream, and then she dies. With any luck, some of these eggs will become members of the next generation of coho salmon that will return to this stream to lay eggs of their own.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                <b>Place your <span data-var="eggLaying" data-format="%.0f eggs"></span> at the head waters, in the egg section. </b>
                            </p>

                            <p>It turns out that about <span data-var="fertilization" class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-min="700" data-max="900" data-step="1" data-format="%.0f of these eggs"></span> are never fertalized by male coho.
                                Then <span data-var="fungusKillsEggs" class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-min="100" data-max="300" data-step="1" data-format="%.0f fertilized eggs"></span> become diseased with a common stream fungus.
                                If that weren't enough, birds eat <span data-var="birdsEatEggs" class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-min="100" data-max="300" data-step="1" data-format="%.0f fertilized eggs"></span>.
                                Then a heavy winter rainstorm hits the watershed, causing flooding and muddy stream conditions that wash <span data-var="rainAndMud" class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-min="350" data-max="450" data-step="1" data-format="%.0f eggs"></span> downstream where they're covered in tick mud, and they never have a chance to hatch.
                            </p>

                            <p>Approximately 40 days after the eggs were fertalized, they begin to hatch. From the eggs emerge small fish called <i>alevin</i>. They have small yolk sacs attached to their bodies, which they'll feed on for several weeks. Alevin stay very close to the bottom of the stream or under the gravel. <b>From the inital <span data-var="eggLaying" data-format="%.0f eggs"></span> only <span data-var="alevin" data-format="%.0f eggs"></span> survived to alevin stage</b>.
                            </p>

                            <p> Not all alevin emerge successfully and <span data-var="eggHatching" class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-min="250" data-max="350" data-step="1" data-format="%.0f alevin"></span> have deformed fins or other mutations that prevent them from surviving.
                                Herons, ducks and kingfishers find alevin at the bottom of the stream and eat <span data-var="birdsEatAlevin" class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-min="250" data-max="350" data-step="1" data-format="%.0f alevin"></span>.
                            </p>

                            <p>Six months have passed since the eggs were first laid. The alevin have absorbed all of the yolk sac and are now called fry. <b>From the surving <span data-var="alevin" data-format="%.0f alevin"></span> only <span data-var="fry" data-format="%.0f alevin"></span> survived to fry stage.</b>

                            <p> Fry swim faster without their yolk sacs, and they move away from the bottom of the stream and out to the edges of the stream, where herons, frogs and other fish eat <span data-var="heronsFrogsAndOtherFish" class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-min="180" data-max="200" data-step="1" data-format="%.0f fry"></span>.
                                It is now the middle of the summer.

                            <p> It's been a little less than a year since the surviving alevin became fry. The surviving fry are now a few inches long. They move downstream and take on a shiny, silver color. As they feed on insects, they reach 6 inches in length. They are now called smolts. The smolts are the first life stage that leaves freshwater and migrates out to the sea. They continue moving down the the river to the estuary. <b>From the surviving <span data-var="fry" data-format="%.0f fry"></span> only <span data-var="smolts" data-format="%.0f fry"></span> survived to smolt stage.</b>

                            <p>Smolts move to the open ocean and grow to adult size. They join schools of coho from other rivers. They spend 1 to 3 years feeding in the ocean and grow to about 2 feet long and about 35 pounds.

                        <p>Underneath that narrative above is a data-supported computational model of coho salmon reproduction. In the model, we assume a mother coho lays a specific number of eggs. As events in the salmon spawning life cycle progress, more and more of those eggs are lost. This is called an event-based model. And now that you've gone through the model in text and interactive numbers, it's time for students to go through the model in an event-driven classroom game called <b>the salmon game</b>.</p>

                    <p>The extension: While a computational model might help you answer a question, create an explanation or support an argument, a good computational model will often <i>motivate more new questions or ideas</i>.

The extension invites students to think more creatively, broadly and/or deeply about the system they are exploring, with the goal of motivating future exploration, curiosity, discovery and excitement.

                <div class="columnLeft">
                    <p>The game detailed above is actually a model of coho salmon spawning, supported by empirical data. It's a specific type of model called an <b>event based model</b> where time doesn't progress in days or months, but instead time progresses in a series of events.</p>

                    <p>In the game, this series of events becomes natural to think about, because the events in the game are concrete, descriptive and fit a narrative. This is a great place to start modeling, because it builds a natural comfort and intuition with the system.</p>

                    <p>We're going to rely on that foundation to begin modeling more abstractly. We do this for two reasons. The first is that if we want to continue to explore the reproductive strategies of the coho salmon, and we limit ourselves to counting beans every time, we won't have enough time to explore very much. </p>

                    <p>The second reason for progressively building abstraction into this concrete model is that abstraction is powerful. If we can thoughtfully abstract across complexity, we can make complexity easier to manage, and refocus our thinking on new questions and new problems. </p>

                    <p>Computational modeling allows us to organize and think more abstractly, so that we can empower ourselves to explore complex systems more deeply and thoughtfully, and use the data that we generate to support hypothesis and explanations and to create more robust arguments based on data.</p>

                    <p>Below is a computational simulation of the exact event driven model played in class.</p>

                <div class="columnRight">
                    <p>The model below, helps us explore the question:</p>

                    <p><b>"How many viable offspring are generated by one mature spawning adult, given these data supported assumptions about survival rates"</b></p>

                    <p>In so far as we trust our reasoning, our data and our assumptions, the answer to this question is: "not very many!" The majority of eggs a mother coho lays never make it to adulthood. Based on our data, and our first model, only 3 in 2,600 eggs from this mother coho grow into adults that return to spawn.</p>

                    <p><i>"In science, if you know what you are doing, you should not be doing it.  In engineering, if you do not know what you are doing, you should not be doing it.  Of course, you seldom, if ever, see either pure state."</i></p>
                    <div class="quoteCitation">&mdash;Richard Hamming, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000P2XFPA">The Art of Doing Science and Engineering</a></div>

                    <p>How can we design systems when we don't know what we're doing?</p>

                    <p>The most exciting engineering challenges lie on the <b>boundary of theory and the unknown</b>.  Not so unknown that they're hopeless, but not enough theory to predict the results of our decisions.  Systems at this boundary often rely on <i>emergent behavior</i> &mdash; high-level effects that arise indirectly from low-level interactions.</p>

                    <p>When designing at this boundary, the challenge lies not in constructing the system, but in understanding it.   In the absence of theory, we must develop an <i>intuition</i> to guide our decisions.  The design process is thus one of exploration and discovery.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="columnRight" style="width:401px;">

                    <p>How do we explore?  If you move to a new city, you might learn the territory by walking around.  Or you might peruse a map.  But far more effective than either is <i>both together</i> &mdash; a street-level experience with higher-level guidance.</p>

                    <p>Likewise, the most powerful way to gain insight into a system is by <i>moving between levels of abstraction</i>.  Many designers do this instinctively.  But it's easy to get stuck on the ground, experiencing concrete systems with no higher-level view.  It's also easy to get stuck in the clouds, working entirely with abstract equations or aggregate statistics.</p>

                    <p>This interactive essay presents the <b>ladder of abstraction</b>, a technique for thinking <i>explicitly</i> about these levels, so a designer can move among them consciously and confidently.</p>

                    <p>I believe that an essential skill of the modern system designer will be using the <i>interactive medium</i> to move fluidly around the ladder of abstraction.</p>
